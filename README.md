# ChromeDinosaurGame
Chrome Dinosaur game made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The game also has an additional scorekeeping feature where the user can keep track of how many obstacles have been jumped over.

In order to run the game, I used VS Code's Live Server extension and selected the HTML file. After successfully downloding the Live Server extension, there will be a symbol at the bottom right of your VS Code tab that says: "Go Live". Select the HTML File and click "Go Live" to connect to a localhost link, which will run the game. 

Another option would be to open a new terminal in VS Code and use the command "start Tutorial.html" to run the game in your browser.
